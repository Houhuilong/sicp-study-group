;; Want to show (= (fib n) (/ (- (pow ϕ n) (pow ψ n)) (sqrt 5)))

;; First, show by inspection that the equation holds for n=0 and n=1

;; Then, assume truth of the formula and show that the presumed expression for
;; (fib (+ n 1)) is correct. I found this to be true.

;; A snaphot of my (disorganized) work is in ex1.13.jpg
