;; For a number much larger than the hard-coded tolerance, and with a small
;; enough tolerance such as 0.001, sqrt will never arrive at a good-enough guess
;; due to the limits on precision in the IEEE standard for floating-point
;; arithmetic (IEEE 754). As shown above, whereas `1.7977e+100` is small enough
;; that a number less than 0.001 (1e-3) from it can be represented, this is not
;; the case for `1.7977e+200`. (I got the "1.7977" part from looking up the
;; highest representable number for double-precision floating-point, which is
;; `1.7977e+308` according to
;; [[http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/realmax.html]], at least in
;; MATLAB. Scheme barfed at that number, so I tried successively decreasing the
;; exponent by large steps).

;; The above works better for small numbers, but it still doesn't work for the
